# Web Food üçî
I made this website following Academind's course on web development.
The purpose of this site was for me to apply my newly gained knowledge of
responsive design. The website was made using HTML and CSS.
# Overview
The home page consists of a simple header and a couple of navigation buttons.
The main section consists of two cards aligned with Grid.
Most of the units used in this page were rem or a percentage
to make the website a bit more responsive than it was before, using pixels for most properties.
The website used Media Query to apply different styles to the page when being viewed from different devices.
If the width of the page reaches a certain size, the website adapts to this change.
The grid of cards becomes one column instead of two, the title is a little smaller,
and the navigation buttons in the header are replaced with a hamburger menu made completely from scratch using
CSS styling and Flexbox.
Pressing the hamburger menu displays a side drawer, and pressing it again hides the drawer.
